A connect 4 game programmed in C!!

To try it you will need to make sure you have installed ncurses:

```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

Once this is set, clone the repository and run in the root directory:

__If it's the first time running the project, you must build it first:__
```
make
```

Run with
```
./main
```

## How to do similar projects:

I used the following bibliography mostly to do this project:

Enjoy.
